/**
 * The word "component" is a hugely overloaded term in the software development
 * industry, but in this context a component is simply a grouping of related
 * functionality encapsulated behind a well-defined interface. If you're using a
 * language like Java or C#, the simplest way to think of a component is that
 * it's a collection of implementation classes behind an interface. Aspects such
 * as how those components are packaged (e.g. one component vs many components
 * per JAR file, DLL, shared library, etc) is a separate and orthogonal concern.
