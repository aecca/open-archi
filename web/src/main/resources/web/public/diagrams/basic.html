    This sample demonstrates tooltips and context menus for all parts and for the diagram background,
    as well as several other powerful diagram editing abilities.
</p>
<p>
    Unlike the <a href="minimal.html">Minimal</a> sample, this sample has templates for Links and for Groups,
    plus tooltips and context menus for Nodes, for Links, for Groups, and for the Diagram.
</p>
<p>This sample has all of the functionality of the Minimal sample, but additionally allows the user to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>create new nodes: double-click in the background of the diagram</li>
    <li>edit text: select the node and then click on the text, or select the node and press F2</li>
    <li>draw new links: drag from the inner edge of the node's or the group's shape</li>
    <li>reconnect existing links: select the link and then drag the diamond-shaped handle at either end of the
        link
    </li>
    <li>group nodes and links: select some nodes and links and then type Ctrl-G (or invoke via context menu)</li>
    <li>ungroup an existing group: select a group and then type Ctrl-Shift-G (or invoke via context menu)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    GoJS contains many other possible commands, which can be invoked by either mouse/keyboard/touch or
    programatically.
    <a href="../intro/commands.html">See an overview of possible commands here.</a>
    On a Mac, use CMD instead of Ctrl.
</p>
<p>
    On touch devices, hold your finger stationary to bring up a context menu.
    The default context menu supports most of the standard commands that are enabled at that time for that object.
