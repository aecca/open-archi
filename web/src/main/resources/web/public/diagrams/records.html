<p>This record mapper shows a number of "fields" for each "record" and how they are mapped between each other.</p>
<p>
    Draw new links by dragging from the background of any field.
    Reconnect a selected link by dragging its diamond-shaped handle.
    The "record" Nodes use a <a>Panel.Table</a> to place the various fields into rows.
    Records are not movable or copyable or deletable.
</p>
<p>For a variation on this sample with selectable fields in the record nodes, see the <a href="selectableFields.html">selectable
    fields</a> sample.</p>
