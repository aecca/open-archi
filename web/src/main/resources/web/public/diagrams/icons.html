<p>This sample shows several "icons" that were originally SVG paths, used as Shapes in GoJS.</p>
<p>Above some icons are shown in a Tree-like Diagram, below a larger selection is shown.</p>
<p>You can easily add your own shapes to GoJS by writing your own geometry strings, or by copying SVG path strings, as
    is done in this sample. The icons for this sample are defined in <a href="icons.js">icons.js</a>.</p>

<p>The icons in this sample are from a selection of free icons at <a href="https://icomoon.io"
