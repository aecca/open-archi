<p>
    Unlike swim lane diagrams where the nodes are supposed to stay in their lanes,
    layer bands run perpendicular to the growth direction of the layout.
</p>
<p>
    This sample uses a custom <a>TreeLayout</a> that overrides the <a>TreeLayout.commitLayers</a> method
    in order to specify the position and size of each "band" that surrounds a layer of the tree.
    The "bands" are held in a single Part that is bound to a particular node data object whose key is "_BANDS".
    The headers, and potentially any other information that you might want to display in the headers,
    are stored in this "_BANDS" object in an Array.
</p>
<p>
    This sample can be adapted to use a <a>GraphLinksModel</a> instead of a <a>TreeModel</a>
    and a <a>LayeredDigraphLayout</a> instead of a <a>TreeLayout</a>.
