<p>
    This sample demonstrates subgraphs that are created only as groups are expanded.
</p>
<p>
    The model is initially a random number of nodes, including some groups, in a tree layout.
    When a group is expanded, the <a>Group.subGraphExpandedChanged</a> event handler calls a function to generate a
    random number of nodes
    in a tree layout inside the group if it did not contain none any.
    Each non-group node added has a unique random color, and links are added by giving each node one link to another
    node.
</p>
<p>
    The addition of nodes and links is performed within a transaction to ensure that the diagram updates itself
    properly.
    The diagram's tree layout and the tree layouts within each group are performed again when a sub-graph is expanded or
    collapsed.
