    This sample demonstrates a custom Layout, TableLayout, that is very much like a simplified "Table" Panel layout,
    but working on non-Link Parts in a Diagram or a Group rather than on GraphObjects in a Panel.
    The layout is defined in its own file, as <a href="TableLayout.js">TableLayout.js</a>.
</p>
<p>
    You can drag-and-drop nodes from the Palette into any Group.
    Dragging into a Group highlights the Group.
    Drops must occur inside Groups; otherwise the action is cancelled.
</p>
<p>
    Each row and each column is <a>Part.resizable</a> and has a custom <a>Part.resizeAdornmentTemplate</a>
    showing a single resize handle on the right side or on the bottom.
    There is a custom LaneResizingTool to provide a minimum width or height based on the contents of all of the
    groups (cells) in that column or row.
</p>
<p>
    This example assumes the Groups are predefined and exist in each cell at a particular row/column,
    but this sample could be extended to allow adding and removing rows and/or columns.
