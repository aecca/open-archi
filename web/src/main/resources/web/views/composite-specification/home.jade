        h2 Composite Specification Pattern
        p
            | The <strong>Composite Specification pattern</strong> is a particular implementation of the "Specification"
            | design pattern, whereby business logic can be recombined by stringing business logic together with Boolean
            | logic. Next we're going to dedicate a little more space to its detailed description.
        p
            | The pattern describes a business logic unit that can be combined with other logical business units. In
            | this pattern, a business logic unit inherits its functionality from the abstract class
            | <strong>CompositeSpecification</strong> by aggregation. The class <strong>CompositeSpecification</strong>
            | has a function called <strong>isSatisfiedBy</strong> that returns a Boolean value. After the instantiation,
            | the specification is "chained" to other specifications, making the new specifications easy to maintain
            | besides offering to the business logic a high level of personalization. On the other hand the instantiation
            | of business logic can, by means of method invocation or control inversion, alter its state to become a
            | delegate of other classes.
        p
            | Here is a class diagram of the basic pattern.
